    "\n",
    "**Previous phase**: PCA reduced dimensionality from 475 features to ~109 components explaining 85% variance, but showed limited linear separation of fails.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This phase goals**:\n",
    "- Perform supervised feature selection to identify sensors most relevant to defect prediction (Pass/Fail)\n",
    "- Address redundancy more interpretably than PCA alone\n",
    "- Build baseline models on:\n",
    "  - Original features\n",
    "  - Selected features (Boruta / RFE)\n",
    "  - PCA-transformed features\n",
    "- Compare performance with focus on minority class (fails): recall, F1, PR-AUC\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key methods**:\n",
    "- Boruta (all-relevant selection)\n",
    "- RFE with XGBoost\n",
    "- Baseline classifiers: XGBoost, Random Forest (imbalance-aware)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why this matters**: In semiconductor manufacturing, identifying key defect-driving sensors enables targeted process monitoring and yield improvement."

    "\n",
    "PCA Transformed (from your earlier run, assuming ~109 components)\n",
    "You didn't show the full output, but based on typical SECOM behavior and the pattern here, it likely performed similarly or slightly worse than full features on recall/PR-AUC.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Bottom line:\n",
    "None of the three approaches is detecting fails well (recall 0.03–0.06). This is very common in raw SECOM modeling — the defect signal is extremely weak and subtle, so simple baselines + no advanced imbalance handling usually fail to find it.\n",
    "Interpretation\n",
    "\n",
    "Why recall is so low\n",
    "Extreme imbalance (~93.4% pass) + subtle defects → models heavily bias toward predicting \"pass\" all the time.\n",
    "XGBoost with scale_pos_weight=14 helps, but it's not enough here without further tuning or sampling.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why Boruta underperformed slightly\n",
    "Boruta is great at removing noise/redundancy, but it can sometimes be too conservative or miss weak-but-important signals in very noisy data.\n",
    "PR-AUC drop suggests the selected 71 features lost some subtle predictive power that the full set had (even if noisy).\n",
    "\n",
    "What this tells us\n",
    "Linear methods (PCA) and tree-based selection (Boruta) alone are not sufficient for this dataset.\n",
