### Associates:



&nbsp;	Hello, my name is Theodore Willis. I was born and raised in the heart of Silicon Valley, the CA Bay Area. I started my education journey at Columbia College in Sonora, CA. I earned my certificate of achievement in fire technology and earned my EMT certificate. I fought fire for almost two years, before my grandparents needed me to move in and take care of them. I was the primary caregiver for my grandparents while finishing my associate's degree in computer programming at Columbia College. During my time at Columbia College, I studied Algebra, Trig, Calculus, Statistics, Computer Programming, Python, Economics, Physics, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, SQL, Operating Systems, etc. At the end of my time at Columbia College, my grandparents passed away and my parents moved to Missouri. I transferred to San Jose State University for the B.S. in Information Science and Data Analytics program.



### Bachelors:



&nbsp;	My degree in Information Science and Data Analytics focuses on using data thoughtfully and responsibly to solve real-world problems. I’m trained across the full data lifecycle—from collecting and managing data to analyzing it at scale and communicating results clearly. A big emphasis of the program is ethical data use, security, and privacy, as well as designing data solutions with real users in mind. We also study how people from different backgrounds interact with technology, which helps me translate technical insights into decisions that actually make sense for diverse teams and stakeholders. Basically, it’s about combining technical data skills with critical thinking and human-centered design.



##### Classes I took at SJSU include:



&nbsp;   	Technical Writing for Information Professionals

&nbsp;   	Technology, Culture, and Society

&nbsp;   	Information and Data Science

&nbsp;   	Big Data Analytics and Management

&nbsp;   	Information Visualization

&nbsp;   	User Centered Interface Architecture and Prototyping

&nbsp;   	Information Architecture

&nbsp;   	Information Security

&nbsp;   	Human Centered Cybersecurity

&nbsp;   	Privacy, Security, Ethics

&nbsp;   	Information Assurance

&nbsp;   	The Emerging Future: Technology Issues and Trends



&nbsp;	I graduated with cum laude my bachelor's degree in December 2025. Since then, I have been working on my GitHub portfolio.



### Portfolio:



##### Key GitHub Projects:

&nbsp;	



###### DarkMoneyProject:



This project collects IRS filings and watchdog narratives to analyze how nonprofits move money, who they fund, and how that connects to political influence.





###### FitnessMaster:



FitnessMaster is a program that securely holds user accounts' login credentials. When users login, they are redirected to a homepage, where they can see and update their current weight, fitness goals, calorie goals, macro and micronutrients goals, and a random weekly workout program.





###### ContinuityOps:



This is ContinuityOps, a project that simulates an internal enterprise student enrollment system for a university.





###### SECOM-Process-Sensor-Analysis:



This project uses the SECOM semiconductor manufacturing sensor data. The purpose of this data science project is to separate relevant features from noise and irrelevant features, and predict failed processes before they happen.





### Future – Goals \& Why I’m Applying:



&nbsp;   **• Short-term focus:**

&nbsp;	◦ Gain hands-on experience in real-world applied data analytics/programming

&nbsp;       ◦ Work with experimental/production data (sensors, process metrics, quality, R\&D) 

&nbsp;       ◦ Collaborate closely with domain experts and program users (students, faculty) 

&nbsp;       ◦ Contribute to impactful, evidence-based decisions in software development/research



&nbsp;   **• Long-term goals:**

&nbsp;       ◦ Become a trusted data scientist who understands both tools and domain deeply 

&nbsp;       ◦ Take more advanced math, Masters degree

&nbsp;       ◦ Deepen technical skills: probability, linear algebra, calculus, differential  equations, numerical methods, advanced 	   modeling/statistics 

&nbsp;       ◦ Grow through on-the-job learning + targeted education (intentional, work-aligned)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;   • **Excited about domains like quantitative finance, chemical/materials manufacturing, AI/ML, Computational Fluid Dynamics, scientific sensor analytics, and propulsion systems**

&nbsp;       ◦ Data supports innovation, process optimization, defect reduction, reliable outcomes, risk management, anomaly detection, etc.
