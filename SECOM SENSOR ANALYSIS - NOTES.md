4\. SECOM - PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS PHASE---

**Multivariate Statistics** is where I will learn more about the principal component analysis (PCA) process, and that class typically comes after all three prerequisites:



Calculus III - Must come first (multivariable calculus is foundational)

Linear Algebra - Usually a prerequisite or co-requisite

Probability Theory - Must come first (statistical foundations)

Typical sequence:



Calculus I, II, III

Linear Algebra (often taken concurrently with or after Calc III)

Probability Theory

Statistics/Inferential Statistics

Then: Multivariate Statistics

Multivariate Statistics builds on all of these because it requires:



Understanding of vectors and matrices (Linear Algebra)

Partial derivatives and optimization (Calculus III)

Probability distributions and inference (Probability Theory)

Basic statistical concepts (Statistics)

So Multivariate Statistics is typically a junior/senior level course taken after 2-3 years of foundational mathematics
